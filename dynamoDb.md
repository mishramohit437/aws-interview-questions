## 1. Introduction to DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS that delivers fast, consistent performance at any scale. Launched in 2012, it was designed to address the limitations of traditional relational databases for high-traffic web applications.

**Key Features:**
- Serverless architecture (no server management required)
- Automatic scaling
- Built-in security
- Backup and restore capabilities
- Global tables for multi-region deployment
- Point-in-time recovery
- Millisecond response times

DynamoDB is used by companies like Lyft, Airbnb, and Netflix to handle massive workloads with minimal operational overhead.

<a name="concepts"></a>
## 2. Core Concepts and Terminology

**Tables**: Similar to relational database tables, a container for items.

**Items**: Similar to rows in relational databases, each item represents a record in a table.

**Attributes**: Similar to columns in relational databases, the properties of an item.

**Partition Key**: The primary identifier for items in a table (also called a hash key).

**Sort Key**: An optional secondary key for organizing items within a partition (also called a range key).

**Secondary Indexes**: Additional access patterns beyond the primary key.

**Read Capacity Units (RCU)**: A measure of read throughput.

**Write Capacity Units (WCU)**: A measure of write throughput.

**Partition**: The physical storage unit where DynamoDB stores data.

<a name="data-model"></a>
## 3. Data Model

DynamoDB uses a flexible schema model where each item can have different attributes. Unlike traditional relational databases, you don't need to define all columns upfront.

**Schema Example:**
```json
{
  "UserID": "user123",
  "Name": "John Doe",
  "Email": "john@example.com",
  "Addresses": [
    {
      "Type": "Home",
      "Street": "123 Main St",
      "City": "Seattle"
    },
    {
      "Type": "Work",
      "Street": "456 Market St",
      "City": "San Francisco"
    }
  ],
  "Metadata": {
    "LastLogin": "2023-01-15T14:22:10Z",
    "AccountCreated": "2022-05-10T09:15:30Z"
  }
}
```

**Data Types:**
- Scalar Types: String, Number, Boolean, Binary, Null
- Document Types: List, Map
- Set Types: String Set, Number Set, Binary Set

<a name="primary-keys"></a>
## 4. Primary Keys

DynamoDB supports two types of primary keys:

**Simple Primary Key (Partition Key only)**:
- Uses a single attribute to uniquely identify each item
- Example: `UserID` as the partition key for a Users table

**Composite Primary Key (Partition Key + Sort Key)**:
- Combines two attributes for unique identification
- Allows multiple items with the same partition key but different sort keys
- Example: `CustomerID` (partition key) and `OrderDate` (sort key) for an Orders table

Choosing the right primary key design is crucial for:
- Even distribution of data across partitions
- Efficient querying and data access patterns
- Avoiding hot partitions (overloaded partitions)

<a name="secondary-indexes"></a>
## 5. Secondary Indexes

Secondary indexes allow you to query data using attributes other than the primary key.

**Local Secondary Index (LSI)**:
- Same partition key as the base table but different sort key
- Must be created at table creation time
- Shares throughput capacity with the base table
- Limited to 5 per table

**Global Secondary Index (GSI)**:
- Can have a different partition key and sort key from the base table
- Can be created or deleted anytime
- Has its own throughput capacity settings
- Limited to 20 per table

**Projected Attributes**: You can choose which attributes to project into an index:
- KEYS_ONLY: Only the index and primary keys
- INCLUDE: Only specified attributes plus keys
- ALL: All attributes from the base table

<a name="operations"></a>
## 6. Read and Write Operations

**Basic Operations:**

- **GetItem**: Retrieves a single item by its primary key
- **PutItem**: Creates a new item or replaces an existing item
- **UpdateItem**: Modifies an existing item's attributes
- **DeleteItem**: Removes an item from a table
- **Query**: Retrieves items with the same partition key
- **Scan**: Examines every item in a table

**Batch Operations:**

- **BatchGetItem**: Retrieves multiple items across multiple tables
- **BatchWriteItem**: Puts or deletes multiple items across multiple tables

**Operation Costs:**

| Operation | Capacity Consumption |
|-----------|----------------------|
| GetItem   | 1 RCU (strongly consistent), 0.5 RCU (eventually consistent) |
| PutItem   | 1 WCU per KB |
| Query     | RCUs based on data returned |
| Scan      | RCUs based on data scanned |

<a name="capacity"></a>
## 7. Capacity Modes

DynamoDB offers two capacity modes:

**Provisioned Capacity Mode**:
- You specify the number of reads and writes per second
- Charges for provisioned capacity regardless of usage
- Auto-scaling can adjust capacity automatically
- Best for predictable workloads

**On-Demand Capacity Mode**:
- Pay-per-request pricing
- Automatically scales up/down based on traffic
- No capacity planning needed
- Best for unpredictable or highly variable workloads
- Generally more expensive than well-optimized provisioned capacity

You can switch between capacity modes once every 24 hours.

<a name="consistency"></a>
## 8. Consistency Models

DynamoDB offers two consistency models for reads:

**Eventually Consistent Reads**:
- Default for most operations
- May not reflect the latest write operations
- Lower cost (0.5 RCU per read)
- Higher throughput

**Strongly Consistent Reads**:
- Always returns the most up-to-date data
- Higher cost (1 RCU per read)
- Lower throughput
- Not available on Global Secondary Indexes

Applications requiring absolute data accuracy should use strongly consistent reads, while others can benefit from the improved performance of eventually consistent reads.

<a name="transactions"></a>
## 9. Transactions

DynamoDB Transactions allow you to group multiple operations together and execute them as a single all-or-nothing operation.

**TransactWriteItems**: Group up to 25 PutItem, UpdateItem, and DeleteItem operations.
**TransactGetItems**: Group up to 25 GetItem operations.

**Use Cases for Transactions:**
- Financial applications requiring account transfers
- Order processing systems
- User profile updates that must maintain data integrity

**Transaction Limitations:**
- Higher cost (2x normal capacity units)
- Limited to 25 items per transaction
- Cannot include operations on global tables

<a name="streams"></a>
## 10. DynamoDB Streams

DynamoDB Streams provides a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in a table.

**Key Features:**
- Captures changes to items (inserts, updates, deletes)
- Stores changes for 24 hours
- Deduplicated and sequenced by timestamp
- Can trigger Lambda functions

**Common Use Cases:**
- Real-time data processing
- Cross-region replication
- Maintaining materialized views
- Implementing audit logs
- Creating event-driven architectures

**Stream Record Components:**
- Stream record contains the item's before and after images
- Each stream record appears exactly once
- Records available in near real-time

<a name="global-tables"></a>
## 11. Global Tables

DynamoDB Global Tables provide a fully managed solution for multi-region, multi-active database deployments.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic multi-region replication
- Active-active configuration (read/write to any region)
- Conflict resolution with "last writer wins"
- Improved application performance for global users
- Business continuity and disaster recovery

**Configuration Requirements:**
- DynamoDB Streams must be enabled
- Same table name across all regions
- All tables must have the same primary key structure

**Best Practices:**
- Deploy tables in regions close to your users
- Design applications to handle eventual consistency
- Monitor replication lag with CloudWatch metrics

<a name="backup"></a>
## 12. Backup and Restore

DynamoDB offers two types of backup capabilities:

**On-Demand Backups**:
- Full backups of table data
- Zero impact on table performance
- Retained until explicitly deleted
- Can be used for long-term retention

**Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**:
- Continuous backups allowing restoration to any point in the last 35 days
- 1-second granularity
- Protects against accidental writes or deletes
- Slightly increases the cost of the table

**Restore Operations**:
- Restores to a new table (cannot overwrite existing tables)
- Indexes, TTL settings, and auto-scaling settings are also restored
- No performance impact on the source table during restore

<a name="security"></a>
## 13. Security Features
